# Principal-Component-Analysis-PCA
## it is dimensionality reduction algorithm
#### Principal component analysis can be broken down into five steps.

1.Standardize the range of continuous initial variables.

2.Compute the covariance matrix to identify correlations.

3.Compute the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix to identify the principal components.

4.Create a feature vector to decide which principal components to keep from eigen values.

5.Recast the data along the principal components axes.
